Contributing to open source GIS projects
Managing your own geospatial code and documentation
Collaborating with distributed teams
Building a professional portfolio
Accessing cutting-edge GIS tools and libraries
This assignment simulates creating a professional GIS project repository, a skill you'll use throughout your career whether contributing to existing projects or starting your own.

ü§ñ Introduction to GitHub Actions
This assignment introduces you to GitHub Actions - automated workflows that run tests and checks on your code. When you commit your repo.txt file, GitHub Actions will automatically:

‚úÖ Validate Repository URL - Checks that you're pointing to your work repository (not the assignment repo)
‚úÖ Verify File Structure - Confirms your work repository has all required folders and files
‚úÖ Test Python Script - Ensures your hello.py script runs successfully

üéØ How to Use GitHub Actions:

Green checkmarks (‚úÖ) = Your work passes basic validation
Red X's (‚ùå) = Click to see detailed error messages and fix issues
Use workflows for debugging - They tell you exactly what's wrong!
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

Passing workflows ‚â† guaranteed grade (instructors review all work)
But they're your best tool for catching common mistakes
All future assignments will have workflows - learn to use them now!
This is the same automation used in professional open source projects like QGIS and PostGIS to ensure code quality before accepting contributions. You're learning industry-standard development practices!

üìù Assignment Overview
Learn GitHub repository management by creating your own professional GIS project repository from scratch, just like real open source developers do.

üéØ Two-Repository Workflow
IMPORTANT: This assignment uses TWO repositories:

üìã Assignment Repository (GitHub Classroom creates this)

Name: ua-gist604b-f25/m1a3-github-repository-management-{your-username}
Purpose: Submission only - contains one file (repo.txt) with your work repository URL
Autograding: Reads repo.txt to find your work repository
üõ†Ô∏è Work Repository (You create this manually)

Name: {your-username}/hello-gist604b
Purpose: All your actual work goes here
MUST BE PUBLIC for autograding to access it
This is where you demonstrate GitHub skills
üì¶ Complete Deliverables List
In Your Assignment Repository (GitHub Classroom):

 repo.txt file containing URL: https://github.com/yourusername/hello-gist604b
In Your Work Repository (hello-gist604b):

Files You Must Create:

 README.md - Main project documentation with your name and learning goals
 LICENSE - MIT License
 .gitignore - Python gitignore template
 docs/learning-log.md - Personal reflection on what you learned
 scripts/hello.py - Python script using template provided below
 data/README.md - Placeholder file (can be empty or describe future data)
Repository Settings You Must Configure:

 Repository name: hello-gist604b
 Repository visibility: PUBLIC
 Repository description: "GIST 604B Assignment 3: Learning GitHub workflows and open source collaboration for GIS projects"
 Repository topics: gis, open-source, education, github-workflow
GitHub Features You Must Create:

 3 Issues with proper labels:
Issue 1: "Improve README with installation instructions" (label: documentation)
Issue 2: "Fix coordinate display format in hello.py" (label: bug)
Issue 3: "Add GIS data processing examples" (label: enhancement)
üöÄ Getting Started
Step 1: Accept Assignment via GitHub Classroom
üéØ IMPORTANT: This assignment has TWO repositories - the assignment repository (for submission) and your personal repository (for the actual work).

Accept the Assignment Repository
Click the GitHub Classroom link provided by your instructor
GitHub Classroom creates your assignment repository: ua-gist604b-f25/m1a3-github-repository-management-{your-username}
This repository is for SUBMISSION ONLY - you'll put one file here with your work repository URL
Step 2: Create Your Own Personal Repository
üéØ CRITICAL: You must create a separate, new repository for your actual work.

Create New Repository

Go to GitHub.com and sign in
Click the "+" button in the top right ‚Üí "New repository"
Name it: hello-gist604b
MUST be PUBLIC (autograding cannot access private repositories)
Add description: "GIST 604B Assignment 3: Learning GitHub workflows and open source collaboration for GIS projects"
Initialize with README
Click "Create repository"
Understanding the Two Repositories

Assignment Repository (ua-gist604b-f25/m1a3-github-repository-management-{your-username}): For submission only
Your Work Repository ({your-username}/hello-gist604b): Where you do all the actual work
This mirrors real open source workflows where you create your own repositories for projects
Step 3: Link Your Repositories
üéØ REQUIRED: Tell the autograder where to find your work.

Create Repository Link File

‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN: Assignment Repository (the GitHub Classroom one)
In your assignment repository (ua-gist604b-f25/m1a3-github-repository-management-{your-username}), create a new file
Name the file: repo.txt
Content: Put ONLY the URL of your personal work repository
Example content: https://github.com/yourusername/hello-gist604b
DO NOT put the assignment repository URL - put your manually created repository URL
Start Working in Your Personal Repository

‚ö†Ô∏è NOW SWITCH TO: Work Repository ({your-username}/hello-gist604b)
Go to your personal work repository at https://github.com/{your-username}/hello-gist604b
This is where you'll create all the required files and structure
All work is completed using GitHub's web interface (no downloads needed)
This is your repository - experiment and explore!
üìÇ Required Repository Structure
Create your repository with this exact structure:

‚ö†Ô∏è In your Assignment Repository (ua-gist604b-f25/m1a3-github-repository-management-{your-username}):

m1a3-github-repository-management-{your-username}/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ repo.txt              # Contains URL of your work repository
‚ö†Ô∏è In your Work Repository ({your-username}/hello-gist604b):

hello-gist604b/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Main project documentation (update this!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE               # Open source license
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore           # Python gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                # Documentation folder
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ learning-log.md  # Your learning reflection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/             # Python scripts folder
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hello.py         # Simple Python script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                # Sample data folder
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
Repository Configuration Requirements
Work Repository Name: hello-gist604b (you create this manually)
Repository Visibility: MUST BE PUBLIC (autograding cannot access private repos)
Repository Description: Add a clear, professional description
README.md: Create comprehensive documentation with your information and learning goals
License: Add MIT License
.gitignore: Add Python gitignore file
Project Organization: Create logical folder structure
Assignment Submission: Create repo.txt in assignment repository with your work repository URL
üìã Step-by-Step Instructions
Step 1: Set Up Assignment Submission
‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN: Assignment Repository (ua-gist604b-f25/m1a3-github-repository-management-{your-username})

In your assignment repository:

Create a new file called repo.txt
Put ONLY the URL of your work repository (the one you created manually)
Example: https://github.com/yourusername/hello-gist604b
Double-check: This should be YOUR manually created repository, NOT the assignment repository
Commit this file
Check GitHub Actions (Automated Tests):

After committing repo.txt, click the "Actions" tab in your assignment repository
Watch as GitHub automatically runs three validation tests:
üîç Validate Repository URL - Confirms repo.txt points to the right place
üìÇ Verify File Structure - Checks that your work repository has required folders/files
üêç Test Python Script - Runs your hello.py to make sure it works
Initially, tests will fail ‚ùå - that's expected! You haven't created the work repository structure yet
As you complete steps 2-4, come back and re-run the Actions (click "Re-run all jobs") to see progress
Goal: All three checks pass with green checkmarks ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ
Step 2: Build Your Work Repository Structure
‚ö†Ô∏è NOW SWITCH TO: Work Repository ({your-username}/hello-gist604b)

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: GitHub doesn't let you create empty directories!

You cannot create a folder by itself in GitHub. Instead, you must create a file INSIDE the folder. To do this, type the folder name, then /, then the filename. GitHub will automatically create the folder for you when you save the file.

Example: To create the docs/ folder with learning-log.md inside it:

Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
In the filename box, type: docs/learning-log.md
GitHub automatically creates the docs/ folder and puts learning-log.md inside it
You'll create folders as you create files in Steps 3-4 below. Don't worry about "creating folders first" - they'll be created automatically when you create files inside them!

Step 3: Create Documentation Files
üí° Continue in: Work Repository ({your-username}/hello-gist604b)

3a. Update Main README.md
Your repository was created with a basic README. Edit it to include:

# Hello GIST 604B

Fill in all bracketed sections with your own content!

3c. Create data/README.md
Create a placeholder file in the data/ folder:

How to create this file:

Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
In the filename box, type: data/README.md (this creates the data/ folder and the file)
Copy the template below into the file content area
Commit the file
Template for data/README.md:

# Data Directory

This directory is a placeholder for future GIS data files.

## Potential Data Types
- Shapefiles (.shp)
- GeoJSON (.geojson)
- Raster files (.tif)
- GPS tracks (.gpx)
Step 4: Create Python Script
üí° Continue in: Work Repository ({your-username}/hello-gist604b)

Create the file scripts/hello.py to demonstrate basic repository organization.

How to create this file:

In your work repository, click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
In the filename box, type: scripts/hello.py (this creates the scripts/ folder and hello.py file together)
Copy and paste the template below into the file content area
Replace ALL bracketed placeholders with your information
Commit the file
Template for scripts/hello.py:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
GIST 604B - Open Source GIS
Module 1 Assignment 3: GitHub Repository Management

Student: [YOUR NAME HERE]
Date: [TODAY'S DATE]
University of Arizona
"""

def main():
    """Simple hello world function for GIST 604B"""
    print("Hello from GIST 604B!")
    print(f"Student: [YOUR NAME HERE]")
    print("Learning open source GIS workflows with GitHub")
    print("University of Arizona coordinates: 32.2319¬∞ N, 110.9501¬∞ W")
    
    # Add your own message here!
    print("[ADD YOUR OWN MESSAGE ABOUT WHY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN GIS]")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
What to replace:

[YOUR NAME HERE] ‚Üí Your actual name (appears twice - in docstring and print statement)
[TODAY'S DATE] ‚Üí Today's date (e.g., "October 21, 2025")
[ADD YOUR OWN MESSAGE...] ‚Üí Your own sentence (e.g., "I'm interested in using GIS for environmental conservation and wildlife habitat mapping.")
Example of completed script:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
GIST 604B - Open Source GIS
Module 1 Assignment 3: GitHub Repository Management

Student: Jane Smith
Date: October 21, 2025
University of Arizona
"""

def main():
    """Simple hello world function for GIST 604B"""
    print("Hello from GIST 604B!")
    print(f"Student: Jane Smith")
    print("Learning open source GIS workflows with GitHub")
    print("University of Arizona coordinates: 32.2319¬∞ N, 110.9501¬∞ W")
    
    # Add your own message here!
    print("I'm interested in using GIS for urban planning and transportation analysis.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Step 5: Configure Repository Settings
üí° Continue in: Work Repository ({your-username}/hello-gist604b)

5a. Add MIT License
In your work repository, click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
Type filename: LICENSE
Click "Choose a license template" button (appears on right side)
Select "MIT License"
Fill in your name where prompted
Click "Review and submit"
Commit the file
Why? Open source projects need licenses to tell others how they can use the code. MIT is a permissive license commonly used in GIS projects.

5b. Create .gitignore File
Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
Type filename: .gitignore
Click "Choose a gitignore template" button (appears on right side)
Select "Python" from the template list
Click "Review and submit"
Commit the file
Why? .gitignore tells Git which files to ignore (like temporary files, cache files). The Python template automatically excludes common Python temporary files.

5c. Add Repository Description and Topics
Go to your repository main page
Click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è next to "About" (top right area)
In the popup window:
Description: GIST 604B Assignment 3: Learning GitHub workflows and open source collaboration for GIS projects
Topics: Type and add these one at a time:
gis
open-source
education
github-workflow
Click "Save changes"
Why? Description and topics help others discover your repository and understand what it's about.

Step 6: Create GitHub Issues
üí° Continue in: Work Repository ({your-username}/hello-gist604b)

Understanding Issues in Open Source: Issues are how developers communicate about bugs, features, and improvements. This is exactly how major GIS projects like QGIS, PostGIS, and GDAL manage development!

You must create exactly 3 Issues with these exact titles and labels:

Issue 1: Documentation Issue
How to create:

Click the "Issues" tab in your repository
Click green "New issue" button
Title: Improve README with installation instructions
Description (copy this):
The README needs clearer installation and usage instructions for new users. Should include step-by-step setup guide and example usage.
Label: Click gear icon next to "Labels" ‚Üí Select "documentation" (or create it if it doesn't exist)
Click "Submit new issue"
Issue 2: Bug Report
How to create:

Click "New issue" button again
Title: Fix coordinate display format in hello.py
Description (copy this):
The coordinates in hello.py should be displayed with proper decimal precision (4 decimal places) and include cardinal directions for clarity.
Label: Select "bug" (create if needed)
Click "Submit new issue"
Issue 3: Enhancement Request
How to create:

Click "New issue" button again
Title: Add GIS data processing examples
Description (copy this):
Would be helpful to add example scripts showing basic GIS operations like coordinate transformations, distance calculations, or data format conversions.
Label: Select "enhancement" (create if needed)
Click "Submit new issue"
How to create labels if they don't exist:

Click "Labels" next to the search box in Issues tab
Click "New label"
Type label name (documentation, bug, or enhancement)
Pick a color
Click "Create label"
Why This Matters: You're practicing the same workflow used by thousands of open source GIS developers worldwide! These Issues demonstrate how teams coordinate work, report problems, and plan improvements.

üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Q: Which repository should I put my work in? A: CRITICAL DISTINCTION:

‚ö†Ô∏è Assignment Repository (ua-gist604b-f25/m1a3-github-repository-management-{your-username}): Only put repo.txt file here
‚ö†Ô∏è Work Repository ({your-username}/hello-gist604b): Put ALL your actual work here (README, scripts, docs, etc.)
Q: What URL goes in repo.txt? A: Put the URL of your manually created work repository, NOT the assignment repository. Example:

‚úÖ CORRECT: https://github.com/yourusername/hello-gist604b
‚ùå WRONG: https://github.com/ua-gist604b-f25/m1a3-github-repository-management-yourusername
Q: My repository is private and autograding failed A: Your work repository MUST be public. Go to Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Danger Zone ‚Üí Change repository visibility ‚Üí Make public

Q: I can't create folders in GitHub's web interface A: You can't! GitHub doesn't allow empty folders. You must create a file INSIDE a folder to create the folder.

How to do it:

Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
In the filename box, type: foldername/filename.md (folder name, then /, then file name)
GitHub automatically creates the folder and file together
Example: To create docs/learning-log.md:

Type docs/learning-log.md as the filename
GitHub creates the docs/ folder with learning-log.md inside it
Q: My Python script shows syntax errors A: Make sure you copied the template exactly and replaced the bracketed placeholders with your actual information. The script should run without errors if you:

Copy the entire template code block
Replace [YOUR NAME HERE] with your actual name
Replace [TODAY'S DATE] with today's date
Replace the bracketed message with your own sentence
Save the file as hello.py in the scripts/ folder
GitHub Actions (Automated Testing)
Q: What are those checkmarks/X's in my repository? A: Those are GitHub Actions - automated workflows that validate your assignment. Think of them as your debugging assistant! Click the "Actions" tab to see detailed results.

Q: GitHub Actions failed - what do I do? A: This is your debugging tool! Read the error messages carefully - each test tells you exactly what's wrong:

üîç Validate Repository URL failed: Check your repo.txt file - make sure it points to hello-gist604b, not the assignment repository
üìÇ Verify File Structure failed: Missing folders or files - create the ones listed in the error message
üêç Test Python Script failed: Your hello.py has errors - check for typos or missing code
Q: Do I need to pass all GitHub Actions to get a good grade? A: Passing workflows means you've met basic requirements, but they don't test everything. Instructors review code quality, documentation clarity, and overall professionalism. Use workflows to catch mistakes, not as a grade guarantee!

Q: How do I re-run GitHub Actions after fixing issues? A: Two ways:

Make any commit to repo.txt (even adding a blank line triggers it)
Go to Actions tab ‚Üí Click latest workflow run ‚Üí Click "Re-run all jobs"
Q: All tests pass but I want to see what they checked A: Click "Actions" tab ‚Üí Click on a successful workflow run ‚Üí Expand each job to see detailed output. This shows you exactly what was validated!

Q: What if GitHub Actions is still running? A: Be patient! Tests take 1-2 minutes to complete. You'll see a yellow circle (üü°) while running, green checkmark (‚úÖ) when passed, or red X (‚ùå) when failed.

Q: Will all future assignments have workflows? A: Yes! Every assignment in this course uses GitHub Actions for basic validation. Learn to use them now - they'll save you time throughout the semester!
